## operaciones matematicas 
``` {r}
dur_hablo_unstressed - dur_hablo_stressed

dur_o_stressed - dur_o_unstressed

int_o_stressed - int_o_unstressed

f0_o_stressed - f0_o_unstressed
```



## comments

1. the duration of the stressed segment and the duration of the streesed vowel was longer on miliseconds than the unestressed segment and vowel

2. the stressed vowel has lower intensity meassured by dB than the unstressed vowel

3. the f0 of the stressed vowel was lower on Hz than the unstressed vowel
